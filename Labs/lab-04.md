# Exercise 4: Import Plugin using OpenAPI

### Estimated Duration: 25 Minutes

## Overview

In this exercise, you will explore the integration of OpenAPI with Semantic Kernel to enhance AI-driven applications. Designed for developers new to API orchestration, the lab guides you through leveraging OpenAPI specifications to load external services as plugins dynamically. You will learn to import the provided WorkItems API as an OpenAPI plugin, enabling seamless interaction through AI-driven prompts. By the end of this lab, you will understand how OpenAPI simplifies API integration, reduces manual coding, and enhances the automation of external service calls.

## Objectives

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Try the app without the OpenAPI Plugin

- Task 2: Create and import the OpenAPI Plugin

## Task 1: Try the app without the OpenAPI Plugin

In this task, you will explore different flow types in Microsoft Foundry by running the app without the OpenAPI Plugin to observe its default behavior.

1. Launch your AI Chat app in any of your preferred languages, and submit the following prompt and see how it responds:

    ```
    What are my work items?
    ```
1. You will receive a response similar to the one shown below, stating that it cannot access the work items:

## Task 2: Create and import the OpenAPI Plugin

In this task, you will explore different flow types in Microsoft Foundry by creating and importing the OpenAPI Plugin to extend the app's capabilities.

    ```
    kernel.add_plugin_from_openapi(
        plugin_name="get_tasks",
        openapi_document_path="http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json",
        execution_settings=OpenAPIFunctionExecutionParameters(
            enable_payload_namespacing=True,
        )
