# Microsoft Foundry and Semantic Kernel Fundamentals

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Lab Scenario

Contoso Innovations is building an AI-powered employee assistant using Microsoft Foundry and Semantic Kernel. As an AI Developer, your task is to enhance the chatbot by integrating Semantic Kernel plugins for time, geolocation, weather, and external OpenAPI services, enabling it to retrieve real-time information and perform intelligent function calling. You will also implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Azure AI Search to help the assistant answer employee questions using organizational knowledge. By the end of the lab, you will have developed a more capable, context-aware AI assistant that combines LLM reasoning with external tools and enterprise data sources.

## Lab Overview

In this hands-on lab series, participants will explore the core capabilities of **Microsoft Foundry** and the **Semantic Kernel** framework to build intelligent, extensible AI applications. Designed for beginners in AI development, the labs guide participants through setting up AI projects in Microsoft Foundry, deploying the **GPT-4o** model, and connecting it seamlessly with Semantic Kernel to enable dynamic, prompt-based interactions. Participants will learn how to integrate **plugins**—such as time and weather utilities—to extend chatbot functionality, implement **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for more informed responses, and leverage **OpenAPI** to connect external services with minimal code. The labs also highlight responsible AI practices with **content filtering tools** in Foundry Studio, delivered in a secure, cloud-based environment. This series provides foundational, hands-on experience with Semantic Kernel and Microsoft Foundry to help participants build scalable, AI-powered applications.

## Objectives

**Explore how Microsoft Foundry and Semantic Kernel empower you to build intelligent, extensible, and responsible AI applications.** Gain hands-on experience deploying GPT-4o models, integrating external services and APIs, developing custom plugins, and implementing advanced AI design patterns such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multi-agent collaboration. By the end of this lab series, you'll be able to:

- **Microsoft Foundry Fundamentals**: Learn how to create, manage, and deploy AI projects using Microsoft Foundry and GPT-4o.
- **Semantic Kernel Fundamentals**: Build an intelligent chat experience by connecting Semantic Kernel with GPT-4o through a simple starter app.
- **Semantic Kernel Plugins**: Extend your chatbot’s capabilities by building and integrating custom Semantic Kernel plugins.
- **Import Plugin using OpenAPI**: Seamlessly integrate external APIs into Semantic Kernel using OpenAPI specifications.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhance AI responses by combining external knowledge retrieval with generative models using the RAG pattern.
- **Responsible AI: Exploring Content Filters in Microsoft Foundry**: Apply content filtering tools to build safer, more accountable AI applications within Microsoft Foundry.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordinate multiple AI agents within Semantic Kernel to solve complex tasks through collaboration.

- (Optional) Understanding of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) patterns for AI applications

## Architecture
In this hands-on lab, participants will explore **Microsoft Foundry** and **Semantic Kernel** to build, deploy, and extend AI-powered applications. The journey begins with the **Azure Portal**, where they will access and manage AI services. They will deploy **GPT-4o** models using **Models + Endpoints**, enabling real-time AI interactions. To enhance response accuracy, participants will implement **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using **Azure AI Search**, ensuring contextually informed outputs.  

The lab also covers **plugins**, such as **Time & Weather utilities** for real-time data retrieval and **OpenAPI integration** to connect external services seamlessly. Participants will explore **content filtering** within Microsoft Foundry, applying built-in safety measures to ensure responsible AI usage. By the end of the lab, participants will have the foundational skills to develop scalable, secure, and extensible AI solutions using Azure’s powerful AI ecosystem.
