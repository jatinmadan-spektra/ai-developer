# Exercise 2: Semantic Kernel Fundamentals
 
### Estimated Duration: 25 Minutes
 
## Scenario

Contoso Innovations wants to enhance its AI assistant by integrating Semantic Kernel to enable intelligent orchestration between AI models and application logic. As an AI Developer, you will build a chat application, connect it to Microsoft Foundry models, and implement Semantic Kernel capabilities such as prompt execution and function calling. 

## Overview

In this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience building an intelligent chat feature using the **Semantic Kernel** framework integrated with the **Microsoft Foundry GPT-4o** model. You will set up the development environment, configure necessary credentials, and implement a chat API that sends user prompts to the GPT-4o model via Semantic Kernel, returning dynamic AI-generated responses within a starter application.

 
## Objectives

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Set up environment variables

- Task 2: Update the code files and run the app.
 
## Task 1: Set up environment variables
 
In this task, you will explore different flow types in Microsoft Foundry by setting up Visual Studio Code, retrieving Azure OpenAI credentials, and configuring them in Python and C Sharp (C#) environments.
